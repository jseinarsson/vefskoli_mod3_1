// This file "style.scss" is the one I translated into css.
// I can load the partials (scss files denoted with an _underscore at the front of the file name) into this file to tell Sass to translate their content into CSS.
// Check out _main.scss and _variables.scss for explanations of the other features used.

// BTW –– Single line comments like this are not translated into the css file.
/* While multi line comments such as this one are.
You should find this comment at the very end of the style.css file */
